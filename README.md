JUSTUS
======

> _"**justus**"_ (latin, adj.): _"proper"_ or _"correct"_.

Justus is a very simple library for _validating_ JavaScript objects and
properly _annotating_ them with TypeScript types.

It focuses in providing an _easy_ and _terse_ syntax to define a simple schema,
used to ensure that an object is _**correct**_ and from which _**proper**_
typing can be inferred.
